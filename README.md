# About The Graduation Project

Implementing VPN Solutions with FortiGate is a practical networking project focused on designing and deploying secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) solutions using Fortinet’s FortiGate firewall.
The project demonstrates how VPN technologies like SSL VPN and IPsec VPN can be configured to provide encrypted, reliable remote access and site-to-site connectivity.

It also integrates SD-WAN capabilities to optimize VPN traffic and enhance overall network performance, ensuring stable and efficient connections across distributed environments.

The outcome of this project is a complete understanding of how to build, configure, and manage secure VPN infrastructures with FortiGate, along with performance evaluations and best practices for real-world deployment.
